**1.** Revisit the marriage, age, and happiness collider bias example from Chapter
6. Run models m6.9 and m6.10 again (pages 178–179). Compare these
two models using both PSIS and WAIC. Which model is expected to make
better predictions, according to these criteria, and which model yields the
correct causal inference?

***Solution***


**2.** Reconsider the urban fox analysis from last week’s homework. On the
basis of PSIS and WAIC scores, which combination of variables best predicts
body weight ($W$, weight)? What causal interpretation can you assign each
coefficient (parameter) from the best scoring model?
